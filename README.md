**The Proxy Pattern**


This is an example of the Proxy pattern.

The Proxy pattern enables you to hide information or limit an object.

A good example of the Proxy pattern being used in real world example is:

In a game of starcraft II the user does not have complete vision of the map.
They only have vision of places that units or buildings can see. You are given
a proxy object of the map vision.
